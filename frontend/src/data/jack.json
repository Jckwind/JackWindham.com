This project progressed in part due to my hands-on approach to learning, starting from naming the platform and designing the logo to addressing technical challenges like switching from a NoSQL to a SQL database. As a college student, I optimized costs by using AWS and Google Cloud's free tiers for backend and user management. Released in October 2019, Cordia allowed users to share music recommendations and connect over shared tastes, integrating with Spotify and Apple Music APIs. Soon after its release, Cordia was recognized in an entrepreneurship competition and development continued. Unfortunately, shifting priorities and the Covid pandemic led to the cessation of active development and promotion and in 2022, I discontinued Cordia's operation. In late 2023, I began working on its revival with an expanded vision, but this redesign is slow-going, as I have to balance this endeavor with other commitments.",

            "description": "In the summer of 2022, I became obsessed with machine learning. I developed a new personal research project, the Wind Model. Written in Python, the model utilized historical sentiment data and financial data for the binary classification of equity price behavior (predicting whether a stock's price would go up or down). The sentiment data was supplied via the public Twitter API, and the financial data via the public Yahoo Finance API and a private Nasdaq API. The model showed some success, performing exceedingly well in *calm* market conditions but struggling in volatile markets. It was powered by a Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm for high-dimensional space analysis and used a genetic optimization algorithm for feature selection. This genetic algorithm was designed to find the optimal feature set for predicting price behavior. The model was retrained nightly, using the previous 30 trading days to optimize the genetic algorithm and identify the current *mood* of the market, or which feature set was most influential in determining price movement. The project was eventually sunsetted due to personal reasons and the high training costs, approximately $600 a month. I have not revisited this project since, not for lack of potential, but rather because my focus is on other projects. I do not plan to open-source the code.",

It was written in Swift, the programming language used to make iOS apps, and the game’s elements were designed using Photoshop and Illustrator. Monetization was achieved through in-app ads and purchases, including character skins and bonus levels. Flip Flop was a significant project for me, blending coding, design, and entrepreneurial skills. The app released in 2017, and received periodic updates to enhance the user experience and showcase my evolving coding skills. However, as I shifted focus to new projects, Flip Flop was gradually retired. This pivotal project laid the foundation for my future work.",
